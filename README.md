# octave-publish

This repository was used to create Matlab compatible [publish][]
and [grabcode][] functions for GNU Octave.
The development has moved to the [GNU Octave repository][].
Both functions will be available in upcoming releases of Octave.

Anyway, the Octave code provided here works standalone.
Read the [documentation][] for further details.

> Release v1.0.0 has to be used for GNU Octave 4.0.x.

The initial `publish` version was taken from the
[Octave-forge package "miscellaneous"]( http://octave.sourceforge.net/miscellaneous/function/publish.html).
