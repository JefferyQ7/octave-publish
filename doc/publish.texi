@node Using Publishing Markup in script files
@section Using Publishing Markup in script files

To use Publishing Markup, start by typing @samp{##} or @samp{%%} at the
beginning of a new line.  For Matlab compatibility three repetitions of
@samp{#} or @samp{%} are treated the same way as two repetitions.

The lines following @samp{##} or @samp{%%} start with only character of
@samp{#} or @samp{%} followed by at least one space and are interpreted as
paragraph, until the first line does not start with @samp{#} or @samp{%} or
the end of the document is reached.

A paragraph starting in the first line of the document, followed by another
start of a paragraph, that might be empty, is interpreted as a document
title and introduction text.

See the example below for clarity:

@example
@group
%% Headline title
%
% Some *bold*, _italic_, or |monospaced| Text with
% a <http://www.octave.org link to GNU Octave>.
%%

# "Real" Octave commands to be evaluated
sombrero ()

## Octave comment style supported as well
#
# * Bulleted list item 1
# * Bulleted list item 2
#
# # Numbered list item 1
# # Numbered list item 2
@end group
@end example



@node Text formatting
@section Text formatting

Basic text formatting is supported inside paragraphs, see the example
given below:

@example
@group
##
# @b{*bold*}, @i{_italic_}, or |monospaced| Text
@end group
@end example

Additionally trademark symbols are interpreted, just embrace the letters
@samp{TM} or @samp{R}.

@example
@group
##
# (TM) or (R)
@end group
@end example



@node Sections
@section Sections

A section is started by typing @samp{##} or @samp{%%} at the beginning of
a new line followed by at least one space and a section title, which are all
characters until a line-break.  Without a section title, the paragraph is
interpreted as a continuation of the previous section.  For Matlab
compatibility three repetitions of @samp{#} or @samp{%} are treated the same
way as two repetitions.

@example
@group
some_code ();

## Section 1
#
## Section 2

some_code ();

##
# Still in section 2

some_code ();

### Section 3
#
#
@end group
@end example



@node Preformatted code
@section Preformatted code

To write preformatted code inside a paragraph, indent the code by three
spaces after @samp{#} at the beginning of each line and leave the lines
above and below the code free, except for @samp{#} at the beginning of
those lines.

@example
@group
##
# This is a syntax highlighted for-loop:
#
#   for i = 1:5
#     disp (i);
#   endfor
#
# And more usual text.
@end group
@end example



@node Preformatted text
@section Preformatted text

To write preformatted text inside a paragraph, indent the code by two
spaces after @samp{#} at the beginning of each line and leave the lines
above and below the preformatted text free, except for @samp{#} at the
beginning of those lines.

@example
@group
##
# This following text is preformatted:
#
#  "To be, or not to be: that is the question:
#  Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
#  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
#  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
#  And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;"
#
#  --"Hamlet" by W. Shakespeare
@end group
@end example



@node Bulleted lists
@section Bulleted lists

To create a bulleted list, type

@example
@group
##
#
# * Bulleted list item 1
# * Bulleted list item 2
#
@end group
@end example

to get output like

@itemize @bullet
@item Bulleted list item 1
@item Bulleted list item 2
@end itemize

Notice the blank lines, except for the @samp{#} or @samp{%} before and
after the bulleted list!



@node Numbered lists
@section Numbered lists

To create a numbered list, type

@example
@group
##
#
# # Numbered list item 1
# # Numbered list item 2
#
@end group
@end example

to get output like

@enumerate
@item Numbered list item 1
@item Numbered list item 2
@end enumerate

Notice the blank lines, except for the @samp{#} or @samp{%} before and
after the numbered list!



@node Including file content
@section Including file content

To include the content of an external file, e.g. a file called
@samp{my_function.m} at the same location as the published Octave script,
use the following syntax to include it with Octave syntax highlighting.

Alternatively, you can write the full or relative path to the file.

@example
@group
##
#
# <include>my_function.m</include>
#
# <include>/full/path/to/my_function.m</include>
#
# <include>../relative/path/to/my_function.m</include>
#
@end group
@end example



@node Including graphics
@section Including graphics

To include external graphics, e.g. a graphic called @samp{my_graphic.png}
at the same location as the published Octave script, use the following syntax.

Alternatively, you can write the full path to the graphic.

@example
@group
##
#
# <<my_graphic.png>>
#
# <</full/path/to/my_graphic.png>>
#
# <<../relative/path/to/my_graphic.png>>
#
@end group
@end example



@node Including URLs
@section Including URLs

Basically, a URL is written between an opening @samp{<} and a closing @samp{>}
angle.

@example
@group
##
# <http://www.octave.org>
@end group
@end example

Text that is within these angles and separated by at least one space from the
URL is a displayed text for the link.

@example
@group
##
# <http://www.octave.org GNU Octave>
@end group
@end example

A link starting with @samp{<octave:} followed by the name of a GNU Octave
function, optionally with a displayed text, results in a link to the online
GNU Octave documentations function index.

@example
@group
##
# <octave:DISP The display function>
@end group
@end example



@node Mathematical equations
@section Mathematical equations

One can insert LaTeX inline math, surrounded by single @samp{$} signs, or
displayed math, surrounded by double @samp{$$} signs, directly inside
paragraphs.

@example
@group
##
# Some shorter inline equation $e^@{ix@} = \cos x + i\sin x$.
#
# Or more complicated formulas as displayed math:
# $$e^x = \lim_@{n\rightarrow\infty@}\left(1+\dfrac@{x@}@{n@}\right)^@{n@}.$$
@end group
@end example



@node HTML markup
@section HTML markup

If the published output is a HTML report, you can insert HTML markup,
that is only visible in this kind of output.

@example
@group
##
# <html>
# <table style="border:1px solid black;">
# <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
# <tr><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>
# </html>
@end group
@end example


@node LaTeX markup
@section LaTeX markup

If the published output is a LaTeX or PDF report, you can insert LaTeX markup,
that is only visible in this kind of output.

@example
@group
##
# <latex>
# Some output only visible in \LaTeX or PDF reports.
# \begin@{equation@}
# e^x = \lim\limits_@{n\rightarrow\infty@}\left(1+\dfrac@{x@}@{n@}\right)^@{n@}
# \end@{equation@}
# </latex>
@end group
@end example

@bye
